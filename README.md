# What?
The project was meant for code manipulation and online analysis, combined with my other project [AppTroy](https://github.com/CvvT/DumpApk)
Due to limits of app samples and my time, I have to put off development of the project and put my energy on my new project.
Hopefully you can see it at the middle of this year.

Thanks for your attention!
